# ELLA

React + Vite + Tailwind frontend for the ELLA web/PWA and Capacitor mobile app.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Mobile shell

Requires Node 22 (`nvm use`), Xcode for iOS, and Android Studio/SDK for Android.

```bash
npm install
npm run mobile:sync
npx cap open ios
# or: npx cap open android
```

`mobile:sync` builds with `https://hri-autism-backend.onrender.com/api` and copies the output into both native projects. To use another backend, set `ELLA_MOBILE_API_BASE` to an HTTPS URL ending in `/api` before running it. The native bundle ID is provisionally `com.ella.parentportal`.

On iOS, parent-mode recording now has a local-only native prototype. It writes an M4A file in the app's private storage and can play or delete the latest saved file. It does not upload audio or update recording sessions/weekly progress yet; do not use this build for study recordings. Android native recording and native push are not implemented.

To validate background recording, run the app on a physical iPhone with an account in an active parent period. Record speech, press Home, lock the phone, and switch apps while recording; return, stop, and play the saved file. Check that speech from each interval is present. Also check that an incoming call is reported as an interruption rather than silently claiming the recording is complete. Simulator results alone are not sufficient for this test.

## Env

Create `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
VITE_WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
```

## Main API

- `POST /api/profiles/login`
- `GET /api/profiles/{caregiverId}`
- `PUT /api/profiles/{caregiverId}`
- `GET /api/daily/summaries?timezone=America/New_York&caregiver_id={id}`
- `GET /api/daily/{date}?timezone=America/New_York&caregiver_id={id}`
- `PUT /api/daily/{date}?timezone=America/New_York&caregiver_id={id}`
- `POST /api/recordings/sessions`
- `GET /api/recordings/sessions/{sessionId}`
- `POST /api/recordings/sessions/{sessionId}/chunks`
- `POST /api/recordings/sessions/{sessionId}/complete`
- `POST /api/subscriptions`
- `PUT /api/subscriptions/{id}`

## Notes

- Daily is single-mode: `condition` is either `robot` or `parent`.
- Dashboard always reads `today`; Diary can still browse selectable dates returned by the backend.
- Recording UI is only enabled when `condition === "parent"`.
- Robot dashboard themes are stored in profile `themes` and edited from the robot dashboard only.
- Web Push uses the backend VAPID public key.
